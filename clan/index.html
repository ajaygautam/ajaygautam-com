<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Two-week vacation is a bit too much. So I was on vacation, and bored, and produced this. (Alien Kane)</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction:</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Designing a clan war strategy is a good example of a coordination problem. If each player optimizes her/his strategy to maximize her/his personal gain (that is, aims as high as possible to get just one star), the clan ends up getting at most one star from each player on the other side, which guarantees a lost war. Getting one star from a higher-ranked player in a lost war pays less than getting three stars from a lower-ranked player in a won war, so everybody would be worse off if everybody optimizes for his/her own good. Sad. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr."><span class="s2">John Nash</span></a>, when figured that out, went crazy (not quite, but a war lost in this fashion happens to be an example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium"><span class="s2">Nash equilibrium</span></a>). So we want to win wars, and to win wars we need to attack responsibly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Experience shows that to win a war we need about 2.5 stars off each enemy base on average, which means that we should try to get something like 2.7 just in case we run into a strong clan. This means that we should try to get 3 stars off the lower two-thirds, and 2 stars off the upper third. Given that the very top players may be hard to 2-star or even 1-star, we should probably aim to 3-star at least the lower three quarters. This, in turn, means that if you attacked somebody in the lower two-thirds and got 2 stars, or somebody in the upper third and got 1 star, your attack is most probably a waste for the clan, because somebody will need to clean up after you. If you got 1 star off somebody in the lower two thirds, it is a guaranteed waste. If everybody does it, we never win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s3"><b><br>
</b></span><span class="s1"><b>Guidelines:</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">0. It is a team game. You are not special, no matter what you have been told previously. So do not be a smart-ass who optimizes his/her strategy for personal gain. Do not think people will not notice, and do not think people will not remember.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Attack only somebody whom you should be able to reliably get 3 stars off (here and below I talk about total stars, not new stars). Be humble. Err on the safe side. Nobody cares about your "positive thinking". Your being ambitious is not good for the clan. Do not adopt the "I think I can" attitude unless you think you are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Engine_That_Could"><span class="s2">little engine</span></a> (and if you do think you are a little engine, please leave the clan and seek attention of a psychiatrist (or a mechanic)).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. If you did not get 3 stars in your first attack, you have proved yourself to be a little engine. Congrats, you choo-choo. Your second attack must be lower, if there are unclaimed stars there. How much lower depends on how miserably you failed in your first attack. You do it to adjust your obviously failed judgment, and also to atone for your failure to benefit the clan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Lower players attack first, to make it clear for the higher players how much clean up is going to be needed and where. Higher players wait to see where they need to clean up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Do not even think of going for loot in your first attack. <i>We need to adopt a loot policy. My view is that a person is entitled to loot only in the last 15 min of the war, only if the war is won, they got 3 stars in their first attack, and cannot possibly get any new stars in their second attack. The reason why we need a loot policy is to prevent the Nash equilibrium when everybody is waiting out to go for loot instead of getting stars. Or we can just prohibit going for loot, period. It is not like the loot is a unalienable right, or getting loot would make people's lives so much better that denying it is cruel.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Basic rules:</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scout the base you want to attack to see how to draw out the cc troops. Sometimes barbarians are sufficient, sometimes you need giants - several of them sometimes. Sometimes one cleverly placed archer is enough. Check how many troops are in the castle, so that you know for sure you have drawn all of them. If you do a hog or giant attack, and there are some wizards or valkyries left in cc, your attack will fail very miserably. Wizards run out of cc after archers. Having proudly killed off 13 archers, you still can have your pigs BBQ'ed by the remaining 3 wizards.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you request for war, be specific, like "wizards for war" or "lvl2+ hogs for war". Do not forget the "for war" part.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Checklist before starting a war battle: spells - cc troops - army (- barb king (- archer queen)). Check that you have whatever applies, and check that you have what you want. If you do your war attack without any of this, you are not being a good clan member.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ignore the "suggestion" from the game whom to attack.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>And one bit which is not war-related:</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Do not upgrade your town hall before you have built and upgraded everything else possible, to the maximum level possible. "Everything" includes gold and elixir collectors, all barracks, bombs, walls, and troop upgrades. Yes, it does include walls, to the maximum level possible. If you do not do it, you are going to regret it mildly at TH7, bitterly at TH8, and at TH9 it may be easier to just start the game anew. The reason is the <a href="http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Town_Hall#Town_Hall_and_Matchmaking"><span class="s2">TH loot penalty</span></a>:</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At higher TH levels, the raiding is harder, and you have higher-level people having reasons to attack you for loot. Say, when you upgrade from TH7 to TH8, you lose almost half of what you could previously get from the stupidly-designed war bases of TH5 and TH6, and you double the amount of what desperate starving people with TH9 and TH10 can harvest off you, inviting them to attack with their scary troops. Also, starting from TH8, upgrades are really expensive, so you may not be able to collect for an upgrade in one raiding session. Being able to preserve the resources between raiding sessions becomes very important at TH8, and you will need every single bit of defense for that, and you need your base to look as formidable as possible.</span></p>
