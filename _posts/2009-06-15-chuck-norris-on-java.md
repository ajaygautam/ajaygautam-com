* Chuck Norris can make a class that is both abstract and final.
* Chuck Norris serializes objects straight into human skulls.
* Chuck Norris doesn’t deploy web applications, he roundhouse kicks them into the server.
* Chuck Norris always uses his own design patterns, and his favorite is the Roundhouse Kick.
* Chuck Norris could use anything in java.util.* to kill you, including the javadocs.

* Chuck Norris demonstrated the meaning of Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY by counting to it, twice.
* A synchronize doesn’t protect against Chuck Norris, if he wants the object, he takes it.
* Chuck Norris doesn’t use javac, he codes java by using a binary editor on the class files.
* Chuck Norris’ java code never needs to be optimized. His code is so fast that it broke the speed of light during a test run in Sun’s labs killing 37 people.
* When someone attempts to use one of Chuck Norris’ deprecated methods, they automatically get a roundhouse kick to the face at compile time.
* The java.lang package originally contained a ChuckNorris class, but it punched its way out the package during a design review and roundhouse kicked Bill Joy in the face.
* Chuck Norris never has a bug in his code, EVER!
